These decisions will be based on the interactions Moctezuma had with Cortés. Each decision made will reflect on the status of gold, food, and soldiers of the Aztec people. After, a quote from Cortés’ letter will explain the events that actually took place and the decisions Moctezuma had to make. Your goal is to improve from the decisions Moctezuma made and analyze some reasons why they could’ve led to his defeat. Good luck and remember you will be quizzed on your ability to analyze what’s happening!
